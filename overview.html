 <h2 style="color:#002d72;"> Statistics for NYC Public Middle Schools </h2>
To give you an introduction to the public middle schools in New York we have gathered some key statistics that will be presented below.
    In general, information about the five boroughs of New York, <i>Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn,  Queens </i> and <i> Staten Island </i> is given.
    However, the first plot shows the total number of schools in each school district and which borough each school district belongs to, so you 
    can track your favorite school district throughout the rest of the plots.
  For a better overview, the color used for each borough is consistent throughout the plots. 
  If you use mouse hover on the plots the exact numbers will be presented.

<div class = "textbox" > 
  On the top plot in the left hand side you can see how many public middle schools there are in each of the 32 school districts.
    Furthermore, the colors indicate which borough each of the districts belong to. The plot below shows you the total number of schools
    in each borough. On the top plot in the right hand side you can see the total number of students enrolled in a public
    middle school in each of the boroughs. The plot below shows the average class size in each borough. This is calculated as the student-teacher ratio.

<div class = "textbox" > 
    Staten Island only has one school district and hence, there are significantly fewer schools and total number of enrolled students in this borough.
    The average class sizes are very similar across the boroughs with the smallest being Bronx's average on 12.5 and the largest being Queens's average with 14.7.

    The top plot in the left hand side shows the average female/male distribution on the schools in each borough. 
    On the right hand side the overall evolution of the female/male distribution from 2006-2018 is shown. 
    The two middle plots show the percentage of each etnicity in each borough and the overall evolution in the percentage of etnicities, respectively. 
    These percentages are based on the number of students from each etnicity that is enrolled in the middle schools and is therefore not necessarily an indication 
	   of the general trend in each borough. In fact, etnicities with a low representation in these plot might be an indication of these groups being more
	  willing to choose private schoolss. 
    The bottom plot in the left hand side shows the rental prices in each borough. We have divided rental prices into three 
	   categories; <i> <20$ per sqft, 20-30$ per sqft</i> and <i> >30$ per sqft </i>. Based on the average rental price in each postal code 
	   the schools have been placed in one of these categories. The plot shows how many percent of the schools in a borough that
	   fall within each category. 
   The plot in the bottom right hand side shows the crimes per 100.000 citizen in each borough. Again, we have divided the number 
	   of crimes into three categories; <i> < 30 felonies per 100.000, 30-60 felonies per 100.000 </i> and <i> >60 felonies per 
	   100.000 </i>. Then, the schools are categorized based on their locations and how many felonies that happen in the area that location fall under.
	  The plot shows how many percent of the schools in a borough that fall within each category.

   The two bottom plots indicate that there is a negative correlation between rental prices and crime rates. Bronx is the borough with the
	   lowest rental prices but is also the borough with the highest number of crimes. In comparison, Manhattan has a high percentage of
	   schools located in areas with a high rental price and is also the borough with most schools located in areas with less than 30 
	   felonies per 100.000.

   The plot in the top left hand side shows the latest average ELA- and Math score in each borough, while the plot next to it shows
   the trend line for the average ELA- and Math score based on the results for all boroughs combined.
   The bottom plots shows the absence rates. These are calculated as the average percentage of students that will be absent on a given school day. 
   In the left hand side this is shown for each borough while the the plot on the right hand shows the trend line from 2006-2018 for all boroughs combined.

<center>		   
  <div class = "textbox" > 
   The plot on the right hand side shows that the average scores in the boroughs are quite close to each other. 
	   Bronx both has the lowest average math score and ELA score with 191 and 205, respectively. Based on this data Bronx is
	   the borough with the lowest rent prices, high crimes rates and lowest test scores, which indicates that this is an area 
	   with more socioeconimically disadvantaged people.
