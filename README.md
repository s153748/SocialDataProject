This repo consists of the html files used for our github webpage made in the course 02806 Social Data Analysis and Visualization on DTU in the spring 2020.

The folder <i>data</i> contains html files and images used in the different tabs. Furthermore two other reps (bokeh and bokeh2) exists; each is used to serve a bokeh application. Both these applications are shown on the "Find School" tab. 

The folder <i>raw_data</i> contains all the raw data, while the folder <i>clean_data</i> contains the cleaned data used for data analysis and visualizations. 

In the folder <i> Python Notebooks </i> the Explainer Notebook can be found, which contains all the code used to clean, explore, analyse and visualize the data.
