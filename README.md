## Social Data and Visualization Project

This repo consists of the project made in the class 02806 Social Data Analysis and Visualization on DTU in the Spring 2020.

In this project, we analysed the schools of New York city and visualized our findings on a [webpage](https://nyc-public-schools.github.io). The code can be seen in our [explainer notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/s153748/SocialDataProject/blob/master/Python%20Notebooks/Explainer%20notebook.ipynb). 

We made a choropleth map where it is possible to choose a variable and explore differences in the school districts and boroughs in relation to this variable.

We also explored specific schools and looked at the historic development of selected variables. Ultimately, we created an interactive application where one can enter preferences and receive an overview of the matching schools.

The folder <i>data</i> contains html files and images used in the different tabs of our website. Furthermore two other repos (bokeh and bokeh2) exists; each is used to serve a bokeh application. Both these applications are shown on the "Find School" tab. The folder <i>raw_data</i> contains all the raw data, while the folder <i>clean_data</i> contains the cleaned data used for data analysis and visualizations. In the folder <i> Python Notebooks </i> the Explainer Notebook can be found, which contains all the code used to clean, explore, analyse and visualize the data.
